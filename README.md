# 👋 Hi, I'm Teddy Mbithi

## 🛡️ Malware Analysis | Exploit Development | Reverse Engineering

I'm a **cybersecurity learner focused on malware analysis and exploit development** with a strong interest in:

* Malware reverse engineering
* Exploit development & vulnerability research
* Threat intelligence & IOC extraction
* Automated malware analysis

I enjoy breaking down malicious software, understanding attacker techniques at a low level, and building tools to analyze, exploit, and mitigate threats.
